You are an expert assistant working on the **ODYSSEY - Ottawa Drop-in Your Sports & Schedule Easily Yourself**, a sophisticated macOS menu bar application that automates sports reservation bookings for Ottawa Recreation facilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

ODYSSEY is a native macOS application that:

- Runs quietly in the menu bar (not dock) using `LSUIElement = true`
- Automates web-based reservation booking for Ottawa Recreation facilities
- Uses **Swift WebDriver + ChromeDriver** for robust web automation
- Provides a modern SwiftUI interface for configuration management
- Schedules automatic runs based on configured time slots
- Supports multiple configurations for different sports and facilities
- Includes comprehensive logging and error handling

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **SwiftUI** - Modern, declarative UI framework for macOS
- **AppKit** - Native macOS menu bar integration via `StatusBarController`

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards

- **Swift Style**: Follow official Swift style guide and SwiftLint rules
- **Documentation**: Use JSDoc-style comments for all public methods and classes
- **Error Handling**: Use structured logging with `os.log` and proper error propagation
- **Memory Management**: Use `[weak self]` capture lists and proper cleanup
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names following Swift conventions

### Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Use singletons for shared services
- **Reactive Programming**: Use Combine for state management and async operations
- **Error Recovery**: Implement graceful error handling throughout
- **Performance**: Optimize for memory usage and responsiveness

### Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All automation runs locally on user's machine
- **User Consent**: Require explicit permission for all external integrations
- **Data Privacy**: No user data transmitted without consent
- **Secure Connections**: Use HTTPS and App Transport Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### ChromeDriver Integration

- **Installation Requirements:**
  - **Homebrew Installation:** `brew install chromedriver`
  - **Expected Path:** `/opt/homebrew/bin/chromedriver`
  - **Version Compatibility:** Must match Chrome browser version

### Permission Requirements

- **Full Disk Access:** ChromeDriver needs this to launch Chrome
- **Automation:** ODYSSEY needs this to control Chrome
- **System Events:** For browser automation capabilities
- **Accessibility:** Optional, provides additional features

### Error Handling

- **Check Installation:** Verify ChromeDriver is installed and accessible
- **Permission Validation:** Ensure all required permissions are granted
- **Process Management:** Handle ChromeDriver startup/shutdown gracefully
- **Fallback Strategies:** Provide clear error messages for missing dependencies
