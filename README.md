## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack

- **SwiftUI** - Modern, declarative UI framework for macOS
- **AppKit** - Native macOS menu bar integration
- **WebKit (WKWebView)** - Native web automation engine
- **Combine** - Reactive programming for async operations and state management
- **UserDefaults** - Persistent configuration storage

## üîß Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Amet13/ODYSSEY.git
cd ODYSSEY

# Install dependencies
brew install xcodegen
brew install swiftlint

# Generate Xcode project
xcodegen

# Build and run
./Scripts/build.sh
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Permissions

ODYSSEY uses minimal permissions for privacy and security:

- **Network Access:** Required for web automation (standard app capability)
- **Notifications:** Optional - for success/failure alerts (user-granted)
- **Standard App Sandbox:** For configuration storage and logging (built-in)

**No special permissions required!** ODYSSEY runs with standard macOS app permissions and doesn't need Full Disk Access, Automation, or Accessibility permissions.

## üîî Notifications

ODYSSEY can send system notifications to alert you when reservations succeed or fail. Here's how to enable them:

### Enabling Notifications

1. **First Launch:** When you first run ODYSSEY, it will automatically request notification permissions
2. **System Preferences:** If you missed the initial request or want to change settings:
   - Open **System Preferences** (or **System Settings** on macOS 13+)
   - Go to **Notifications & Focus** (or **Notifications** on older versions)
   - Find **ODYSSEY** in the list of apps
   - Enable **Allow Notifications**
   - Choose your preferred notification style (Banner, Alert, or None)

### Notification Types

- **üéâ Success Notifications:** Sent when a reservation is completed successfully
- **‚ùå Failure Notifications:** Sent when a reservation fails (with error details)

### Troubleshooting Notifications

If you're not receiving notifications:

1. **Check System Preferences:**

   - Ensure ODYSSEY has notification permissions enabled
   - Verify notification style is set to "Banner" or "Alert" (not "None")

2. **Check Focus Mode:**

   - Make sure Focus mode isn't blocking notifications from ODYSSEY
   - Add ODYSSEY to allowed apps in Focus settings if needed

3. **Restart the App:**

   - Quit and relaunch ODYSSEY to re-request permissions

4. **Check Logs:**
   - Use `./Scripts/logs.sh` to see if notification permission errors are logged
   - Look for messages like "Notification permission denied" or "Cannot send notification - permission not granted"

### Notification Content

- **Success:** "üéâ Reservation Successful! [Sport] at [Facility]"
- **Failure:** "‚ùå Reservation Failed [Sport]: [Error Message]"

Notifications are sent immediately when reservations complete, helping you stay informed about your booking status.
