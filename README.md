### For Developers

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](Documentation/DEVELOPMENT.md) for build and development setup instructions.

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Configuration

1. **Add a Reservation Configuration**:

   - Click the ODYSSEY menu bar icon
   - Click "Add Configuration"
   - Fill in the facility URL, sport name, and time slots
   - Configure contact information

2. **Set Up Contact Data**:

   - Enter your phone, name
   - Enter your IMAP/Gmail settings
   - Test Email connection

3. **Run Reservations**:

   - **Manual Run**: Click "Run Now" for immediate execution
   - **Automatic**: Will be executed exactly at 6PM, 2 days prior to the event

4. **Browser Windows**:

> **Important:**
> To avoid Google reCAPTCHA and other anti-bot detection, browser windows must remain visible during automation. Hiding or minimizing these windows may increase the risk of being flagged as a bot and cause reservations to fail. The automation simulates real user activity in a visible window for maximum reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

- **Automation fails with reCAPTCHA or bot detection**

  - Ensure browser windows remain visible during automation (do not minimize or hide).
  - Try running the app at a different time or with a different network.
  - Make sure your configuration matches the facility's current website structure.

- **Email verification not working**

  - Double-check your IMAP/Gmail credentials and App Password (for Gmail).
  - Test your email connection in Settings.
  - Check for typos in your email address or server.
  - For Gmail, ensure 2FA is enabled and you are using an App Password.

- **Keychain or credential errors**

  - If you see a Keychain error banner, try re-entering your credentials in Settings.
  - Make sure you have granted Keychain access to ODYSSEY.
  - Restart the app after updating credentials.

- **App does not appear in menu bar**

  - Ensure you are running macOS 15.0 or later.
  - Check that the app is not running in the Dock (it should only appear in the menu bar).

- **Logs not showing in Console.app**
  - Search for `ODYSSEY` or `com.odyssey.app` in Console.
  - Make sure logging is enabled in your system settings.
