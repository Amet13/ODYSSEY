### For Developers

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](Documentation/DEVELOPMENT.md) for build and development setup instructions.

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Configuration

1. **Add a Reservation Configuration**:

   - Click the ODYSSEY menu bar icon
   - Click "Add Configuration"
   - Fill in the facility URL, sport name, and time slots
   - Configure contact information

2. **Set Up Contact Data**:

   - Enter your phone, name
   - Enter your IMAP/Gmail settings
   - Test Email connection

3. **Run Reservations**:

   - **Manual Run**: Click "Run Now" for immediate execution
   - **Automatic**: Will be executed exactly at 6PM, 2 days prior to the event

4. **Browser Windows**:

> **Important:**
> To avoid Google reCAPTCHA and other anti-bot detection, browser windows must remain visible during automation. Hiding or minimizing these windows may increase the risk of being flagged as a bot and cause reservations to fail. The automation simulates real user activity in a visible window for maximum reliability.

## How to Add a New Sport, Facility, or Configuration

ODYSSEY is designed for easy expansion. To add support for a new sport, facility, or reservation configuration:

### 1. Update Sport Keywords (if needed)

- Edit `Sources/Utils/AppConstants.swift` and add your new sport to the `sportsKeywords` array.
- This ensures the UI and icon mapping recognize the new sport.

### 2. Add or Update Facility URLs

- In the app UI, add a new configuration and enter the facility URL for the new location.
- If the facility uses a new URL pattern, update the validation logic in `ValidationService.swift` as needed.

### 3. Test Facility Scraping

- The app uses `FacilityService` and JavaScript scraping to detect available sports at each facility.
- If the new facility has a unique page structure, update the detection script in `JavaScriptService.swift` (see `generateAntiDetectionScript` and related methods).

### 4. Add/Update Icons (Optional)

- To add a custom icon for your new sport, update `SportIconMapper.swift`.

### 5. Validate Your Addition

- Use the app UI to create a new configuration for your sport/facility.
- Run a test reservation and ensure:
  - The sport is detected and selectable.
  - The reservation flow completes without errors.
  - The correct icon and name appear in the UI.

### 6. Write/Update Tests (Recommended)

- If you add new scraping or validation logic, add or update tests in the relevant service (e.g., `FacilityService`, `ValidationService`).

### 7. Document Your Change

- Update this README and any relevant documentation to describe the new sport/facility/configuration.

**Best Practices:**

- Keep all new keywords, URLs, and logic centralized in the appropriate constants/services.
- Test thoroughly with real facility pages.
- Use the modular JavaScriptService for any new scraping or anti-detection logic.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your addition.
