### For Developers

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](Documentation/DEVELOPMENT.md) for build and development setup instructions.

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Configuration

1. **Add a Reservation Configuration**:

   - Click the ODYSSEY menu bar icon
   - Click "Add Configuration"
   - Fill in the facility URL, sport name, and time slots
   - Configure contact information

2. **Set Up Contact Data**:

   - Enter your phone, name
   - Enter your IMAP/Gmail settings
   - Test Email connection

3. **Run Reservations**:

   - **Manual Run**: Click "Run Now" for immediate execution
   - **Automatic**: Will be executed exactly at 6PM, 2 days prior to the event

4. **Browser Windows**:

> **Important:**
> To avoid Google reCAPTCHA and other anti-bot detection, browser windows must remain visible during automation. Hiding or minimizing these windows may increase the risk of being flagged as a bot and cause reservations to fail. The automation simulates real user activity in a visible window for maximum reliability.
