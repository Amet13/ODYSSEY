## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Core Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns:** Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Protocol-oriented design:** Use protocols for interfaces and dependency injection.
- **Dependency injection:** Centralized service management for better testability.
- **Concurrency safety:** Proper actor isolation and thread safety throughout.
- **Error handling:** Comprehensive error handling with clear categorization.
- **Security first:** Always use secure storage (_Keychain_) for sensitive data.
- **Performance:** Optimize for memory usage and responsiveness.
- **Validation:** Centralized input validation and sanitization.
- **Constants management:** Centralized constants for maintainability.

### Modular Architecture

ODYSSEY uses a **modular Swift Package Manager** architecture with two main targets:

- **`ODYSSEY` (GUI):** macOS menu bar application built with SwiftUI
- **`ODYSSEYBackend` (Library):** Shared backend services and automation engine

### Architecture Layers

- **Presentation:** User interface and user interaction logic (`Views/`, `Controllers/`)
- **Application:** Business logic orchestration and use cases (`Application/`)
- **Domain:** Core business entities and domain logic (`Domain/`)
- **Infrastructure:** External services, automation, and data persistence (`Infrastructure/`, `Services/`)
- **Shared:** Common utilities and protocols (`SharedUtils/`, `SharedCore/`)

## 🧪 Code Quality & Testing

### Automated Quality Checks

The project includes comprehensive automated quality checks:

- ✅ Project structure validation.
- ✅ Comprehensive linting with `./Scripts/odyssey.sh lint`.

### Example: Running All Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks
./Scripts/odyssey.sh lint

# Build the application
./Scripts/odyssey.sh build

# Clean build artifacts
./Scripts/odyssey.sh clean
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

The unified CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`) automatically runs all quality checks on every commit and pull request.

### 🧹 Code Quality Standards

The project maintains high code quality standards with:

- **📝 Consistent Logging:** All log messages use emojis and proper punctuation.
- **🎯 DRY Principle:** No code duplication, centralized validation and utilities.
- **🔧 Clean Architecture:** Modular services with clear separation of concerns.
- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation:** Up-to-date guides and examples.
- **⚡ Performance:** Optimized for speed and memory efficiency.
- **🛡️ Security:** Secure credential storage and input validation.

## 🏗️ Service Architecture

### JavaScript Modular Library

ODYSSEY uses a **modular JavaScript library** for all web automation functionality, organized across multiple specialized files. This approach provides:

- **Clean Separation:** JavaScript code is completely separated from Swift code.
- **Modular Organization:** JavaScript functions are organized by purpose across multiple files:
  - `JavaScriptCore.swift`: Core automation functions and element interactions
  - `JavaScriptForms.swift`: Form handling and field filling functionality
  - `JavaScriptPages.swift`: Page detection and state checking functions
  - `JavaScriptLibrary.swift`: Main library that combines all modules
- **Maintainability:** Related functions are grouped together for easier maintenance.
- **Reusability:** Reusable functions across all services.
- **Consistency:** Standardized error handling and logging patterns.
- **Debugging:** Easier to debug JavaScript issues with organized, modular structure.

### Modular Design Principles

The codebase follows a modular service-oriented architecture with these key principles:

#### Service Categories

- **Email Services:** Handle email integration, authentication, and verification (`EmailService`, `EmailKeychainHelper`).
- **Reservation Services:** Manage booking logic, status tracking, and orchestration (`ReservationOrchestrator`, `ReservationErrorHandler`).
- **WebKit Services:** Provide browser automation and web interaction capabilities (`WebKitService`, `WebKitAntiDetection`).
- **Infrastructure Services:** Handle data persistence, configuration, and utilities (`ConfigurationService`, `UserSettingsManager`).

#### Build System

- **GUI Application:** Built using Xcode project (generated from `Config/project.yml`) with `xcodebuild`
- **Shared Library:** `ODYSSEYBackend` provides common services to the GUI
- **Unified Build:** Always use `./Scripts/odyssey.sh build` for consistent builds

### Development Guidelines

#### Adding New Services

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each service should have one clear, well-defined purpose.
2. **Protocol-First Design:** Define clear interfaces before implementation.
3. **Dependency Injection:** Use centralized service management for testability.
4. **Concurrency Safety:** Ensure proper actor isolation and thread safety.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Document all public APIs with clear examples.

#### Code Quality Standards

- **swift-format Compliance:** Follow established code style guidelines.
- **Documentation:** Use JSDoc-style comments for all public methods.
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling.
- **Performance:** Optimize for memory usage and responsiveness.

#### Automated Workflows

- ✅ **Unified Script Usage:** GitHub Actions now use our existing scripts instead of duplicating commands.
- ✅ **Version consistency validation** (tag vs project.yml vs Info.plist).
- ✅ **DMG installer creation** with app icon.
- ✅ **Code signing** for the application.
- ✅ **GitHub Releases publication** with comprehensive notes.
- ✅ **File size tracking** and reporting.
- ✅ **Professional release notes** with installation instructions.

## 🧪 Testing

### GUI Testing

- **God Mode:** Activate it by pressing `Command+G` in the app to show **GOD MODE** button and **Advanced Settings**.
- **Manual Testing:** Test all UI interactions and automation flows.
- **Log Monitoring:** Use `./Scripts/odyssey.sh logs` to monitor real-time logs.
- **Browser Window:** Optional for development and support. By default, automation runs invisibly. Enable "Show browser window" in God Mode Advanced Settings to monitor automation and diagnose issues.
- **Build Testing:** The GUI app is built using Xcode project generation and `xcodebuild`.

### 📸 Screenshots and Retention

- Failure screenshots are saved under `~/Library/Application Support/ODYSSEY/Screenshots`.
- Retention policy: 30 days. Old screenshots are cleaned on app startup via `FileManager.cleanupOldScreenshots(maxAge:)` using `AppConstants.defaultScreenshotRetentionDays`.

### 🛠️ God Mode Features

- Toggle "GOD MODE" via Command+G to reveal advanced controls.
- Advanced Settings include:
  - Show browser window (optional) and auto-close on failure.
  - Use custom autorun time (override default 6:00 p.m.).
  - Use custom prior days (override default 2) for scheduling calculations to facilitate debugging/testing.

## 🚀 Release Process

The release process uses a streamlined workflow with automated CI/CD:

### Automated Release Process

The release process is fully automated through GitHub Actions and can be initiated using the unified script:

1. **Create a new release** using the unified script:

```bash
./Scripts/odyssey.sh release 1.1.1
```

This command will:

- Validate the version format
- Update version in all files (`project.yml`, `Info.plist`, `AppConstants.swift`)
- Build and test the application
- Commit changes with a descriptive message
- Create and push git tag
- Push changes to main branch

### Build System Details

- **GUI Application:** Uses Xcode project generation (`xcodegen`) and `xcodebuild`
- **Shared Library:** `ODYSSEYBackend` provides common services to the GUI target
- **Unified Approach:** Always use `./Scripts/odyssey.sh build` for consistent builds

### 🤖 Automated CI/CD Workflow
